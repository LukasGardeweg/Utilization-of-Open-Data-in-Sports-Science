# **How are Open Data Used in Sports Science? A Systematic Review and Bibliometric Analysis of all Studies Citing the Open Football Dataset Published by Pappalardo et al. in 2019**

## *Background & Aim*
Despite the growing importance of big data, large, publicly available datasets are still relatively rare. However, these could form the basis for reproducible and transparent research and enable the development of new data analysis methods. 
The aim of this paper is to use a systematic review and bibliometric analysis to provide an overview of the research questions, methodological approaches, and possible applications that exist in dealing with such datasets and how the scientific community has dealt with them so far.
